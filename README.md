# VirtualSolarSystem
Virtual Solar System mapped after realistic properties

# Description
A project developed in unity which implements a solar system which accurately maps the system as we know it.

## Solar System Properties & Implementations
Distance scaling 1KM:10000KM
Planet scaling (maintaining their porportional scaling to other planets) Diameter/Distance scaling * planet scaling;
Accurate planet axial tilt
Accurate planet dimension : diameter/orbit length/day length etc...




current revision uses pre-defined orbits, calculated relative to the distance to the sun and the length of time to orbit around it.
futher revision will consider implementing gravity.
