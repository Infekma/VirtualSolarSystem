# VirtualSolarSystem
A project developed in Unity which implements a solar system which accurately maps the system as we know it.

## Solar System Properties & Implementations
Distance scaling 1KM:10000KM

Planet scaling (maintaining their porportional scaling to other planets) Diameter/Distance scaling * planet scaling;

Accurate planet axial tilt

Accurate planet dimension : diameter/orbit length/day length etc...

Time scaling to increase speed of galaxy

All solar system planet properties are a accurate approximation.

Current revision uses pre-defined orbits, calculated relative to the distance to the sun and the length of time to orbit around it.

Futurerevision will consider implementing gravity.
